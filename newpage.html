 <h1 style="text-align:center;"> This is my Linux Reference Page</h1>
 <p>This is where I will keep all my Linux commands</p>
 <li> ls command
</li>
<p>Use the ls command to know what files are in the directory you are in. The ls command is used for viewing files, folders and directories. For example if I wanted to see which files are in my website directory i would type in ls.</p>

<li>cd command</li>
<p>The cd command - change directory - will allow the user to change between file directories. As the name command name suggest, you would use the cd command to circulate between two different directories. For example if I wanted to go from my home directory to my website directory I would type in cd website.
</p>
<li>mkdir command</li>
<p>Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory. For example, if I wanted to create a directory by the name of website I would type in mkdir website.
</p>
<li>rmdir / rm commands</li>
<p>Use rmdir to delete a directory. But rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory. To delete a file, use rm. For example, if I wanted to delete an empty directory by the name of website I would type in Rmdir website.
</p>
<li>man command</li>
<p>Inputting the man command will show you all information about the command you are using. This command is very useful as it can be used to learn more about certain linux commands. For example, if I wanted to learn more about the cd command I would type in man cd. After putting in this command it will display the manual or all the relevant information for the change directory command.
</p>
<li>mv command</li>
<p>Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a file. For example, if I wanted to change a file name from version1.html to version 2.html I could type in mv version1.html version2.html.
</p>
<li>chmod command</li>
<p>Use chmod to make a file executable and to change the permissions granted to it in Linux. For example, letâ€™s say that you have a bash script called rpistatus. To make the file executable you would type in + chmod rpistatus.
</p>
<li>Ping command</li>
<p>Use ping to check your connection to a server. It measures this round-trip time and gives you the details about it. The use of this command for simple users like us is to check your internet connection. For example, if you wanted to ping one of the other rpis in the room all you need to type in is ping rpi03 or ping rpi04.
</p>
<li>Touch command</li>
<p>The touch command is used to create a file. Just as the mkdir command makes directories, the touch command makes files. For example, if you wanted to create a text file by the name of test you would type in touch test.txt.
</p>
<li>Locate command</li>
<p>The locate command is used to locate a file in a Linux system. This command is useful when you don't know where a file is saved or the actual name of the file. For example if you know the name of a file contains the words first and rpi you can type in locate *first**rpi*. This will return the file with the words first and rpi.
</p>
<li>clear command</li>
<p>You can use the clear command to clear the terminal if it gets filled up with too many commands. For example, if the terminal gets very cluttered and you want a fresh slate you can just type in clear and the terminal will be wiped.
