 <h1 style="text-align:center;"> This is my Linux Reference Page</h1>
 <p>This is where I will keep all my Linux commands</p>
 <li> ls
</li>
<p>The ls command allows the user to know what files are in a directory. The ls command is used for viewing files, folders and directories.</p>
<li>chmod </li>
<p>chmod makes a file executable and allows the user to change the permissions. Generally, you type  in +chmod to change the permissions.$
</p>
<li>cd </li>
<p>The cd command - change directory - will allow the user to change between file directories. As the name command name suggest, you would use the cd command to circulate between two different directories. For example if I wanted to go from my home directory to my website directory I would type in cd website.
</p>
<li>mkdir</li>
<p>The mkdir command is used to create a folder or a directory. Ie mkdir website makes a directory called website.
</p>
<li>rmdir </li>
<p>rmdir is used to delete a directories. rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory. To delete a file, rm is used.
</p>
<li>man </li>
<p>Inputting the man command will show you all information about the command you are using. This command is very useful as it can be used to learn more about certain linux commands. For example, if I wanted to learn more about the cd command I would type in man cd. After putting in this command it will display the manual or all the relevant information for the change directory command.
</p>
<li>mv</li>
<p>The mv command is used to move files through the command line. It can also be used to rename a file. 
</p>
<li>Ping </li>
<p>ping is used to check your connection to a server. It measures this round-trip time and gives you the details about it. The use of this command for simple users like us is to check your internet connection.
</p>
<li>Touch </li>
<p>The touch command is used to create a file. Just as the mkdir command makes directories, the touch command makes files. For example, if you wanted to create a text file by the name of test you would type in touch test.txt.
</p>
<li>clear</li>
<p> The clear command to clear the terminal if it gets filled up with too many commands.
